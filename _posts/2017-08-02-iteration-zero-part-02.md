The vibration of my smart watch wakes me up, I don't bother to open my eyes, I'll reach the watch with my right hand and turn its bezel to stop the vibration. Then I roll on the bed and bump to my wife. She does not move, I'm happy that I didn't wake her up.

That would be good if I could sleep a little more. I still feel so tired. Then I hear cars roaring from the half open windows. It's mid summer and the weather is getting warmer. Our bed room is faced toward a crowded highway and with this heat we can't close the windows.

The watch starts to vibrate again. I can't believe ten minutes has been passed so quickly. I hardly open my eyes, then each out to my watch and try to enter the pin to stop the snooze.

- "Pin error" watch shows on the screen.
I try again.

- "Pin error"!
I hate it when I can't enter four digits correctly on this tiny screen.

- "Pin successful".

Finally I did it. Now I'm too awake to go back to sleep again, sigh!

I brush my teeth and take a shower, then I look at my watch. It's 06:50. I hear someone calling me.

- John, JOHN ...

It's my wife, her name is Kathrine, because of the shower noise, I didn't hear her before and now she's loudly shouting my name.

- Yes honey
- It's getting late, please wake up Paul.

Paul is our son, he is 6 years old and is going to kindergarten. He usually wakes up before us but last night he insisted to play some silly games till late night.

- Ok honey!

I head to the living room, I remove phone from the charger and tap it over the speaker. The "connected" sign appears on the phone and I play some music, it feels a bit too rhythmic for early morning but that's the easiest way to wake up everyone.

Then I head to Paul's room, roll up the blinds and sun rays get into the room. He rolls over to avoid the sun light. I leave the room without saying anything.

A few minutes later, everyone is at the breakfast table. I look at my watch its 7:30 I'm thinking to catch 7:45's train. I dress up to leave the home. Paul runs after me and asks all sort of silly questions, it's getting late.

- Daddy will bring something sweet from the office, if I could catch the next train.
- K chocolate? OK daddy?
- Yes, sure.

 "Don't promise to buy chocolates, Paul had enough yesterday.", Kathrine says out loud.

- OK, honey.

"Mommy is not my friend, daddy is my friend." Paul responds.

I smile and close the door.
