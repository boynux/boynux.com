Version 0.3.1 of gh-pages-blog was just released.

This is a minor release that fixes a couple of bugs. The first bug was a duplicate 'a' that has been removed. The second was an invalid &lt;docs&gt; reference in the rss.xml. Thanks to [larsks](https://github.com/larsks) for both discovering the bugs and providing the fixes.
